        <h1>My Favorite Blueberry Cobbler</h1>

        <p>In a shock to no one, I have a lot of thoughts about the perfect
            summer cobbler. Cobbler is a sweetened fruit base topped with a wet
            biscuit batter that bakes up to be something between a cake and a
            biscuit atop simmering fruit. A cobbler is not a crisp (though this
            apple crisp really stands the test of time). A cobbler is no time
            for oats – no time for streusel. Biscuit business only. Cinnamon and
            nutmeg? Not now, pals – we’ll see you in the autumn. This blueberry
            cobbler recipe is my ideal – and to let you in on the first secret –
            mix fresh blueberries with fresh blackberries. Their sweetness and
            seeds are the perfect compliment to cooked blueberries.
        </p>
        <p>And I hear you wondering - can I use frozen blueberries for this
            recipe? Sure thing! I would thaw and drain the berries before using
            but if you decide to go with a bunch of frozen berries because
            you’re a rebel pressed for time, just know your cobbler will be a
            bit more loose and juicy than the cobbler pictured here.

        <h2 class="customhead">Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Berries:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups, fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>2 cups, fresh blackberries (large berries cut in half)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup, granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons, lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/4 cup, all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Pinch, kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons, cold unsalted butter (cut into cubes)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups, all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons, cornmeal</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons, granulated sugar (plus more for sprinkling)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon, baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon, kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup, cold unsalted butter (cut into cubes)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup, buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>Vanilla ice cream for serving</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven
                to 425 degrees F.
            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl stir together the berries, sugar, and lemon
                zest. Sprinkle the flour over the top of the mixture as well as
                a pinch of salt. Toss until thoroughly combined and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>To make the dough, in a large bowl combine flour, cornmeal,
                sugar, baking powder, and salt. </li>
            <li>Add the cubes of butter and use a pastry blender (or your hands)
                to work the ingredients into a coarse meal. Some peas will be
                the size of small peas, others will be little flakes of butter.
            </li>
            <li>In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together
                buttermilk and egg. Add the wet ingredients all at once to the
                dry ingredients and stir to combine. The mixture will be lumpy
                and clumpy.</li>
            <li>Spoon the berry mixture into a 9×13-inch pan. Dot the top of the
                berries with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Tear pinches
                of the dough from the bowl, and place them on top of the berries
                like little cobblestones. Sprinkle with a few tablespoons more
                sugar.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil
                and bake for 20-25 minutes more until the topping is deeply
                golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with
                vanilla ice cream.</li>
            <li>Cobbler can be stored in an airtight container in the
                refrigerator for up to 3 days and can be reheated before
                enjoying leftovers.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I used a 9×13-inch baking pan for this mega cobbler because
                cobbler, when made, should be shared with everyone you know. But
                it’s also easy to cut this recipe in half and bake it in a 8×8
                or 9×9-inch square pan.</li>
            <li>There’s also a good case for serving this perfect summer dessert
                at room temperature, ya know, at a sunset picnic, as we do.
                Store and leftover cobbler in the fridge and reheat the
                following morning for breakfast.</li>
        </ul>
